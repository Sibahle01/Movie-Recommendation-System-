# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
A Python-based machine learning project that implements a movie recommendation system using real-world data. This system demonstrates both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to suggest relevant movies to users based on their preferences or past behavior.

The project walks through the full pipeline of building a recommendation engine, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Feature extraction (genres, ratings, similarities)

- Model building using pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn

- Evaluation of recommendation performance

#ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Learn
The difference between content-based and collaborative filtering

How to compute similarity scores using cosine similarity and correlation

How to structure movie rating data for recommendation engines

Real-world use cases of recommendation systems in tech and media

#ðŸ§  Tools & Libraries Used
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional, for visualizing results)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis

#ðŸ“Š Sample Features
- Recommend movies based on genre or similarity to a selected title
- Recommend movies based on user behavior (collaborative approach)
- Modular code structure for easy extension and experimentation

#ðŸ”— How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open Movie_Recommendation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run each cell and experiment with different titles or user IDs

#ðŸ§  Future Improvements (Optional section)
Add Matrix Factorization using SVD

Turn into a web app using Streamlit

Integrate with a real-time API like The Movie Database (TMDb)
